# Abacus: Automattic's Experimentation Platform UI

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Automattic/abacus.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Automattic/abacus)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- `npm`

### Update Your System Host File

In order for our OAuth authorization to work, it needs to be given a redirect URI that has been declared as acceptable. In order to aid with using the site locally, add the following DNS mapping to your system's host file.

```
127.0.0.1 a8c-abacus-local
```

### Spin up your Development server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Check your code

```bash
# Run all tests and checks
npm run verify

# Code testing
npm run test:all

npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e -- --watch
npm run test:e2e -- --updateSnapshot

npm run test:integration
npm run test:integration -- --watch
npm run test:integration -- --updateSnapshot

npm run test:unit
npm run test:unit -- -- --watch
npm run test:unit -- -- --updateSnapshot
DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT=30000 npm run test:unit # For when react-test-library truncates your debug output


# Code formatting
npm run format:check
npm run format # Fixes formatting

# Code linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:ts:fix # Fixes lint issues
```

### Build for Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing Tips/Notes

### Where to find tests

- Integration: `/__tests__`
- E2E: `/e2e`
- Unit tests: Rest of the codebase, alongside file it is testing.

### E2E Testing tips

Our e2e tests use Jest and Puppeteer in a headless Chrome browser.

#### Smoke Tests:

We have smoke tests that are inteded to be used in development for quick iterations.

```
npm run test:e2e:smoke
```

#### Debugging

For debugging, you'll likely want to run with a full visual browser. To do that:

1. Create a .env file at the project's root if it does not already exist.
   You can copy the .env.example file as an initial template.
1. Add `PUPPETEER_HEADLESS=false`.
   This will cause the E2E tests to run in a browser that can be visually seen.

See https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/debugging for more debugging tips.

### Use Production Config/APIs

Since we don't have a mock server it is important to test on the Production config/APIs.

To do so, spin up your dev server like this:

```bash
REACT_APP_PRODUCTION_CONFIG_IN_DEVELOPMENT=true npm run dev
```

See `/config.ts` for more info.

### Auth Flow

We don't currently have a log-out feature but it can be necessary to log a user out for testing, this is how to do so manually:

Once a user is authenticated and they authorize Abacus to have access, we save the authorization info in local storage under the key `experiments_auth_info`. To simulate using Abacus on a new browser or the access token expiring, you can remove this item from local storage using the Chrome devtools > Application tab.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks have been put in place via `husky` which will run the `precommit` NPM script. This script runs `lint-staged` but could be used to run different or more commands. The `lint-staged` command will run commands on only the staged files of the commit according to the configuration. The `lint-staged` configuration is in `package.json`.

### "DebugMode"

We currently have a special debug mode which adds in-development features as well as extra debug information.
To activate it hold shift and double click on the footer.

### Switching between production and local

Save this as a bookmarklet to switch between prod and local:

```javascript
javascript: window.location.href =
  window.location.origin === 'https://experiments.a8c.com'
    ? window.location.href.replace(new RegExp('^https?://[^/]+'), 'http://a8c-abacus-local:3000')
    : window.location.href.replace(new RegExp('^https?://[^/]+'), 'https://experiments.a8c.com')
```

## Advanced Tools

### Docker (_Not Recommended_)

You can use the following commands to run the server in a Docker container:

- `npm run docker-build`: Build a docker image that runs a production Abacus server at port 3000.
- `npm run docker-start`: Run the above docker image, mapping port 3000 from the image to port 8888 on your local machine.

### Bundle Analysis (_Not Recommended_)

_Shouldn't be a concern for this App_

The Next.js build creates two bundles of files. One for the client and one for the server.

Running the following will build, analyze, and open two browser windows with a report on the client and server bundles.

```sh
npm run analyze
```
