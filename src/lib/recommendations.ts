 * # Recommendations
 *
 * > "A difference is a difference only if it makes a difference."
 * > Darrell Huff in “How to Lie with Statistics”
 *
 * ## Definitions
 *
 * - CI: Credible Interval, the bayesian version of a Confidence Interval.
 *   Without otherwise specifying we mean the 95% CI, this means it is an area
 *   which is 95% likely to contain the real value of what we are measuring.
 *
 * - minDifference: Experimenters set this for each MetricAssignment, this
 *   defines what sort of difference is practical.
 *
 * - ROPE: "Region of Practical Equivalance".
 *   The interval of [-minDifference, minDifference].
 *
 * ## Statistical Significance
 *
 * A difference CI is statistically significant if it doesn't contain 0.
 * This is the classical method used in statistics and isn't something we use
 * for recommendations but is included for debugging and better understanding
 * results.
 *
 * ## Practical Significance
 *
 * A difference CI is practically significant if it doesn't contain any part of
 * the ROPE. Practical significance is what we use for recommendations.
 *
 * Benefits of practical significance:
 * - More accurate burden of proof - tailored to the experimenters' decisions around specific metrics.
 *   For example a diff CI can be better than zero, but cost more to fully implement than any benefit from it.
 *   By using practical significance we can set the point of decision to exactly when the benefit outweighs the cost.
 * - Gives us a way to determine how long an experiment should run for - if the
 *   CI and ROPE only partially overlap the real value could be either within the
 *   ROPE or outside of it, we don't know. It turns out this is an unbiased way of
 *   letting us know that we should collect more data and run the experiment
 *   longer.
 * - Able to make decisions against implementing something.
 *   If the CI is contained in the ROPE we can actually reject the change completely.
 *
 * Practical significance is part of the approach described in
 * https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/06/19/making-bayesian-ab-testing-more-accessible/, which is based on
 * http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/11/optional-stopping-in-data-collection-p.html.
 *

 * * Precision as a goal for data collection: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_mlm7M63Y7j641Y7QJG3TfSxeZMGOsQ4
